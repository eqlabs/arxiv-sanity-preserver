# arxiv sanity preserver

## Modifications
This is a dockerized version of Karpathy's original, fit to fetch cryptography, blockchain, distributed systems, and networking papers from Arxiv.

### Build the image(s)
```bash
docker-compose build sanity
```

### Running the platform
```bash
./create_volumes.sh
docker-compose up -d
```

### Fetching new papers
To get new papers on a day-to-day basis on the platform, one needs to create a scheduled run of the fetcher. To run the fetcher, we have the following command:
```bash
./run_fetcher.sh
```

## Old info

### Processing pipeline

The processing pipeline requires you to run a series of scripts, and at this stage I really encourage you to manually inspect each script, as they may contain various inline settings you might want to change. In order, the processing pipeline is:

1. Run `fetch_papers.py` to query arxiv API and create a file `db.p` that contains all information for each paper. This script is where you would modify the **query**, indicating which parts of arxiv you'd like to use. Note that if you're trying to pull too many papers arxiv will start to rate limit you. You may have to run the script multiple times, and I recommend using the arg `--start-index` to restart where you left off when you were last interrupted by arxiv.
2. Run `download_pdfs.py`, which iterates over all papers in parsed pickle and downloads the papers into folder `pdf`
3. Run `parse_pdf_to_text.py` to export all text from pdfs to files in `txt`
4. Run `thumb_pdf.py` to export thumbnails of all pdfs to `thumb`
5. Run `analyze.py` to compute tfidf vectors for all documents based on bigrams. Saves a `tfidf.p`, `tfidf_meta.p` and `sim_dict.p` pickle files.
6. Run `buildsvm.py` to train SVMs for all users (if any), exports a pickle `user_sim.p`
7. Run `make_cache.py` for various preprocessing so that server starts faster (and make sure to run `sqlite3 as.db < schema.sql` if this is the very first time ever you're starting arxiv-sanity, which initializes an empty database).
8. Start the mongodb daemon in the background. Mongodb can be installed by following the instructions here - https://docs.mongodb.com/tutorials/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu/.
  * Start the mongodb server with - `sudo service mongod start`.
  * Verify if the server is running in the background : The last line of /var/log/mongodb/mongod.log file must be - 
`[initandlisten] waiting for connections on port <port> `
9. Run the flask server with `serve.py`. Visit localhost:5000 and enjoy sane viewing of papers!

Optionally you can also run the `twitter_daemon.py` in a screen session, which uses your Twitter API credentials (stored in `twitter.txt`) to query Twitter periodically looking for mentions of papers in the database, and writes the results to the pickle file `twitter.p`.

I have a simple shell script that runs these commands one by one, and every day I run this script to fetch new papers, incorporate them into the database, and recompute all tfidf vectors/classifiers. More details on this process below.

**protip: numpy/BLAS**: The script `analyze.py` does quite a lot of heavy lifting with numpy. I recommend that you carefully set up your numpy to use BLAS (e.g. OpenBLAS), otherwise the computations will take a long time. With ~25,000 papers and ~5000 users the script runs in several hours on my current machine with a BLAS-linked numpy.

### Running online

If you'd like to run the flask server online (e.g. AWS) run it as `python serve.py --prod`.

You also want to create a `secret_key.txt` file and fill it with random text (see top of `serve.py`).
