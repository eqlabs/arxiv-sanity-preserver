## How to use
Now researchers, engineers and developers working in the P2P, crypto, and blockchain spaces have their own Arxiv Sanity Preserver! Crypto-Sanity filters papers from the categories cs.[CR|DC|NI], which mean "Cryptography and Security", "Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing", "Networking and Internet Architecture", respectively. Without creating a user account, you can filter papers by the full text search found on the very top of the listed papers. The search also accepts the aforementioned categories themselves in the form "cs.CR" etc.

In the upper right corner there's a combined sign up and sign in form. After creating an account, you can save individual papers to your library by pressing the up-to-date floppy disk icon. You can access your saved papers in the library tab, and based on your saves you'll get recommended papers in the recommended tab, updated nightly. You can also add friends by their username from your profile page, after which you can see what papers they've saved to their libraries.

There's some features, like "top hype", which don't yet work, but will be worked on if deemed important. Please check the code out, suggest improvements, and report any bugs to our GitHub at https://github.com/eqlabs/crypto-sanity-preserver/issues 

## Modifications
This is a dockerized version of Karpathy's original, fit to fetch cryptography, blockchain, distributed systems, and networking papers from Arxiv.

### Build the image(s)
```bash
docker-compose build sanity
```

### Running the platform
```bash
./create_volumes.sh
docker-compose up -d
```

### Fetching new papers
To get new papers on a day-to-day basis on the platform, one needs to create a scheduled run of the fetcher. To run the fetcher, we have the following command:
```bash
./run_fetcher.sh
```
Run it manually or with a crontab.
